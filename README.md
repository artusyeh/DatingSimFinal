Milestone 1:
This week the project advanced significantly functionally and visually. The timer system was integrated into the scene, which stops and resets depending on the dialogue choices. Particle effects and sound feedback were added to button choices, providing clear responses for correct and wrong decisions. Dialogue branching now supports proper right and wrong paths, with different particle effects for the good/bad endings. A custom dialogue box sprite was designed and implemented to frame text more cleanly, improving the overall UI. We made progress on the JSON dialogue structure, the creation and animation of character sprite parts, and the development of animated cutscenes. The text system was refined to display dialogue smoothly, and button‑clicking sounds were added for extra polish. We also began experimenting with the Minit timer mechanic; for this milestone the focus was on simply getting it functional and integrated, with plans to refine and smooth out its behavior in upcoming milestones.
